# Academic Planner Web App

This is the web version of the Academic Planner application. It's a simple, clean, and modern UI to manage your academic tasks.

## 🚀 Features

-   **Add, Edit, and Delete Tasks**: Easily manage your tasks with a user-friendly modal.
-   **Color-Coded Tasks**: Tasks are color-coded by type (School, Coaching, Self-study) and priority (High, Medium, Low).
-   **Dark/Light Mode**: Switch between dark and light themes for your comfort.
-   **Persistent Storage (Local)**: Tasks are currently stored in a local `tasks.json` file.
-   **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to work on different screen sizes.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

-   **HTML**: The structure of the app.
-   **CSS (Tailwind CSS)**: For modern and utility-first styling.
-   **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: For the application logic.

## 🏃‍♀️ How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository** (or download the files).
2.  **Open `index.html`** in your web browser.

That's it! The app will load the tasks from the `data/tasks.json` file.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

-   **GitHub Integration**: Connect the app to the GitHub API to read and write tasks from a repository file, allowing data persistence across devices.
-   **View Modes**: Implement Day, Week, and Month views to filter tasks.
-   **Drag and Drop**: Allow reordering of tasks using drag and drop.
-   **Search and Filter**: Add functionality to search and filter tasks.
