## ðŸš€ Setup and Deployment

### 1. Prerequisites

*   A GitHub Account.
*   Two GitHub repositories:
    1.  A repository for the application code (this one).
    2.  A separate, empty repository to store the `tasks.json` data file (e.g., `adcplannerDATA`).

### 2. Configuration

To get the application running and syncing with your GitHub account, follow these steps:

#### A. Configure `script.js`

Open the `script.js` file and update the following constants with your details:

```javascript
const GITHUB_USERNAME = 'YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME';
const GITHUB_REPO = 'YOUR_DATA_REPO_NAME'; // e.g., 'adcplannerDATA'
const FILE_PATH = 'data/tasks.json'; // You can leave this as is
```

#### B. Create a Personal Access Token (PAT)

The application uses the GitHub API to write data. You need to create a Personal Access Token with the correct permissions.

1.  Go to **GitHub Settings** > **Developer settings** > **Personal access tokens** > **Tokens (classic)**.
2.  Click **"Generate new token"**.
3.  Give it a descriptive name (e.g., `ADCPLANNER_TOKEN`).
4.  Set an expiration date.
5.  Under **"Select scopes,"** check the **`repo`** scope. This is essential for the app to read and write files to your repository.
6.  Click **"Generate token"** and copy the token immediately. You won't be able to see it again.

#### C. Add the Token as a GitHub Secret

To keep your token secure, we use GitHub Actions to inject it during deployment.

1.  In your **application code repository**, go to **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**.
2.  Click **"New repository secret"**.
3.  For the **Name**, enter `TOKEN_GITHUB`.
4.  For the **Secret**, paste the Personal Access Token you just created.
5.  Click **"Add secret"**.

### 3. Deployment

The project is set up to deploy automatically to GitHub Pages whenever you push a change to the `main` branch.

1.  Commit and push your configured code to your application repository.
2.  Go to the **"Actions"** tab in your repository to monitor the deployment workflow.
3.  Once the workflow is complete, go to **Settings** > **Pages**. Your site should be live at `https://<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>.github.io/<YOUR_CODE_REPO_NAME>/`.
